I'm a **PHP** developer at heart and have been professionally since around 2007.  I've dabbled in Ruby a fair few times but never stuck with it.  I'm teaching myself **Python** at the moment as a fair few colleagues have coded in it and they all have good things to say about the language.

I know PHP fairly damn well - enough to know where to look for things which I don't understand or know of, and I can figure out a new API or concept easily as I know the language.  However with Python the concepts, syntax and semantics are somewhat different and I'm constantly finding myself in the situation where I want to do something simple, which I could do in 1 minute or less in PHP, but because I have no idea about Python I end up spending 5 times as long trying to figure it out.

I've decided to try and do a few posts on **Python vs PHP** where I'll show how I've achieved the same outcome in both languages.  As I'm learning the language there's going to be some simple stuff here and I apologise if any of it is wrong or retarded, but if it helps someone who's in the same position as me then I'm happy.

Here's a list of **Python vs PHP** posts:

Also read a post about [Learning Python](/learning-python-the-pragmatic-way) where you can see some code comparisons between Python and PHP.  There's some discussion of interest on [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4853019).
