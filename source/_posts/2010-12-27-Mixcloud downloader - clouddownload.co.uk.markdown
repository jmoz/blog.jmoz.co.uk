I use **Mixcloud** all the time.  My iPhone is loaded with mixes from the site.  A common complaint heard from users is that they don’t provide you with **download** links, so I wrote a little app that parses their JSON and gets you a list of the mp3 download links.  I’ve also added some features like a list of recently downloaded cloudcasts and a formatted tracklist that you can paste in your iTunes lyrics field.  I’ve uploaded it to my VPS and pointed a domain to it.

So if you want to [download Mixcloud](http://clouddownload.co.uk) mp3s, check out [clouddownload.co.uk](http://clouddownload.co.uk).

I’m working on adding support for Soundcloud as well, so look out!
